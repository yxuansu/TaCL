yang ##li ##u ##qing ( ) is a market town in xi ##qing district , in the western suburbs of tianjin , people ' s republic of china .
despite its relatively small size , it has been named since 2006 in the " famous historical and cultural market towns in china " .
it is best known in china for creating ni ##an ##hua or yang ##li ##u ##qing ni ##an ##hua .
for more than 400 years , yang ##li ##u ##qing has in effect specialised in the creation of these wood ##cut ##s for the new year .
wood block prints using vivid colours ##che ##mes to portray traditional scenes of children ' s games often inter ##wo ##ven with aus ##pic ##ious ##e objects .
, it had 27 residential communities ( ) and 25 villages under its administration .
shi family grand courtyard ( tianjin shi jia da yuan , 天 [UNK] 石 家 大 [UNK] ) is situated in yang ##li ##u ##qing town of xi ##qing district , which is the former residence of wealthy merchant shi yuan ##shi - the 4th son of shi wan ##cheng , one of the eight great masters in tianjin .
first built in 1875 , it covers over 6 , 000 square meters , including large and small yards and over 200 folk houses , a theater and over 275 rooms that served as apartments and places of business and worship for this powerful family .
shi ##fu garden , which finished its expansion in october 2003 , covers 1 , 200 square meters , incorporates the elegance of imperial garden and del ##ica ##cy of south garden .
now the courtyard of shi family covers about 10 , 000 square meters , which is called the first mansion in north china .
now it serves as the folk custom museum in yang ##li ##u ##qing , which has a large collection of folk custom museum in yan ##li ##u ##qing , which has a large collection of folk art pieces like yan ##li ##u ##qing new year pictures , brick sculpture .
shi ' s ancestor came from dong ' e county in shandong province , engaged in water transport of grain .
as the wealth gradually accumulated , the shi family moved to yang ##li ##u ##qing and bought large tracts of land and set up their residence .
shi yuan ##shi came from the fourth generation of the family , who was a successful businessman and a good household manager , and the residence was thus enlarged for several times until it acquired the present scale .
it is believed to be the first mansion in the west of tianjin .
the residence is symmetric based on the axis formed by a passageway in the middle , on which there are four archway ##s .
on the east side of the courtyard , there are traditional single - story houses with rows of rooms around the four sides , which was once the living area for the shi family .
the rooms on north side were the accountants ' office .
on the west are the major constructions including the family hall for worship ##ping buddha , theater and the south reception room .
on both sides of the residence are side yard rooms for maids and servants .
today , the shi mansion , located in the township of yang ##li ##u ##qing to the west of central tianjin , stands as a surprisingly well - preserved monument to china ' s pre - revolution mercantile spirit .
it also serves as an on - location shoot for many of china ' s popular historical dramas .
many of the rooms feature period furniture , paintings and call ##igraphy , and the extensive shi ##fu garden .
part of the complex has been turned into the yang ##li ##u ##qing museum , which includes displays focused on symbolic aspects of the courtyard ##s ' construction , local folk art and customs , and traditional period furnishings and crafts .

latin liturgical rites , or western liturgical rites , are catholic liturgical rites employed by the latin church , the largest particular church sui i ##uri ##s of the catholic church , that originated in europe where the latin language once dominated .
its language is now known as ecclesiastical latin .
the most used rite is the roman rite .
the latin rites were for many centuries no less numerous than the liturgical rites of the eastern autonomous particular churches .
their number is now much reduced .
in the aftermath of the council of trent , in 156 ##8 and 1570 pope pius v suppressed the br ##ev ##ia ##ries and miss ##als that could not be shown to have an antiquity of at least two centuries ( see trident ##ine mass and roman miss ##al ) .
many local rites that remained legitimate even after this decree were abandoned voluntarily , especially in the 19th century .
in the second half of the 20th century , most of the religious orders that had a distinct liturgical rite chose to adopt in its place the roman rite as revised in accordance with the decrees of the second vatican council ( see mass of paul vi ) .
a few such liturgical rites persist today for the celebration of mass , since 1965 – 1970 in revised forms , but the distinct liturgical rites for celebrating the other sacrament ##s have been almost completely abandoned .
the roman rite is by far the most widely used .
like other liturgical rites , it developed over time , with newer forms replacing the older .
it underwent many changes in the first millennium and a half of its existence ( see pre - trident ##ine mass ) .
the forms that pope pius v , as requested by the council of trent , established in the 1560 ##s and 1570 ##s underwent repeated minor variations in the centuries immediately following .
each new typical edition ( the edition to which other printing ##s are to conform ) of the roman miss ##al ( see trident ##ine mass ) and of the other liturgical books superseded the previous one .
the 20th century saw more profound changes .
pope pius x radically rear ##rang ##ed the ps ##al ##ter of the br ##ev ##iary and altered the rub ##ric ##s of the mass .
later pope ##s continued to make such changes , beginning with pope pius xii , who significantly revised the holy week ceremonies and certain other aspects of the roman miss ##al in 1955 .
the second vatican council ( 1962 – 1965 ) was followed by a general revision of the rites of all the roman rite sacrament ##s , including the eu ##cha ##rist .
as before , each new typical edition of an official liturgical book super ##sed ##es the previous one .
thus , the 1970 roman miss ##al , which superseded the 1962 edition , was superseded by the edition of 1975 .
the 2002 edition in turn super ##sed ##es the 1975 edition both in latin and , as official translations into each language appear , also in the vernacular languages .
under the terms of sum ##mo ##rum pont ##ific ##um by pope benedict xvi , the mass of paul vi is known as the ordinary form of the roman rite .
the trident ##ine mass , as in the 1962 roman miss ##al , is still authorized for use as an extraordinary form of the roman rite under the conditions indicated in the document sum ##mo ##rum pont ##ific ##um .
the or ##dina ##ria ##te use is a form or variation of the roman rite , rather than a unique rite itself .
during the liturgy of the eu ##cha ##rist , especially the eu ##cha ##rist ##ic prayer , it is closest to other forms of the roman rite , while it differs more during the liturgy of the word and the pen ##ite ##ntial rite .
the language used , which differs from that of the ice ##l translation of the roman rite of mass , is based upon the book of common prayer , originally written in the 16th century .
prior to the establishment of the personal or ##dina ##ria ##tes , parishes in the united states were called " anglican use " and used the book of divine worship , an adaptation of the book of common prayer .
the book of divine worship has been replaced with the similar divine worship : the miss ##al for use in the or ##dina ##ria ##tes worldwide .
anglican liturgical rituals , whether those used in the or ##dina ##ria ##tes of the catholic church or in the various prayer books and miss ##als of the anglican communion and other denominations trace their origin back to the sar ##um use , which was a variation of the roman rite used in england before introduction during the reign of edward vi of the 154 ##9 book of common prayer , following the break from the roman church under the previous monarch henry viii .
in the united states , under a pastoral provision in 1980 , personal parishes were established that introduced adapted anglican traditions to the catholic church from members ' former episcopal parishes .
that provision also permitted , as an exception and on a case by case basis , the ordination of married former episcopal ministers as catholic priests .
as personal parishes , these parishes were formerly part of the local roman catholic diocese , but accepted as members any former anglican who wished to make use of the provision .
on 9 november 2009 , pope benedict xvi established a worldwide provision for anglican ##s who joined the church .
this process set up personal or ##dina ##ria ##tes for former anglican ##s and other persons entering the full communion of the catholic church .
these or ##dina ##ria ##tes would be similar to dioceses , but encompassing entire regions or nations .
parishes belonging to an or ##dina ##ria ##te would not be part of the local diocese .
these or ##dina ##ria ##tes are charged with maintaining the anglican liturgical , spiritual and pastoral traditions , and they have full faculties to celebrate the eu ##cha ##rist and the other sacrament ##s , the liturgy of the hours and other liturgical functions in accordance with the liturgical books proper to anglican tradition , in revisions approved by the holy see .
this faculty does not exclude liturgical celebrations according to the roman rite .
the personal or ##dina ##ria ##te of our lady of wal ##sing ##ham was set up for england and wales on 15 january 2011 , and the personal or ##dina ##ria ##te of the chair of saint peter for the united states and canada on 1 january 2012 , and the personal or ##dina ##ria ##te of our lady of the southern cross for australia on 15 june 2012 .
as of 2017 it was decreed that all parishes in the united states established under the pastoral provision be transferred to the or ##dina ##ria ##te .
bishop steven lo ##pes of the personal or ##dina ##ria ##te of the chair of saint peter has requested that terms such as " anglican use " and " anglican or ##dina ##ria ##te " be avoided , saying " our clergy and faithful do not like being called anglican , both because this is ins ##ens ##itive to actual anglican ##s , and because it is a subtle way of suggesting that their entrance into full communion is less that total .
we are catholic in every sense " .
also called " indian masses " , a number of variations on the roman rite developed in the indian missions of canada and the united states .
these originated in the 17th century , and some remained in use until the second vatican council .
the priest ' s parts remained in latin , while the or ##dina ##ries sung by the choir were translated into the vernacular ( e . g . , mohawk , al ##gon ##quin , mic ##mac , and huron ) .
they also generally featured a reduced cycle of native - language proper ##s and hymns .
at present they are rarely used .
the za ##ire use is an inc ##ult ##ura ##ted variation of the ordinary form of the roman rite of the roman catholic church .
it has been used to a very limited extent in some african countries since the late 1970s .
the am ##bro ##sian rite is celebrated in most of the archdiocese of milan , italy , and in parts of some neighbouring dioceses in italy and switzerland .
the language used is now usually italian , rather than latin .
with some variant texts and minor difference in the order of readings , it is similar in form to the roman rite .
its classification as gall ##ica ##n - related is disputed .
the rite of bra ##ga is used , but since 18 november 1971 only on an optional basis , in the archdiocese of bra ##ga in northern portugal .
the mo ##zar ##abi ##c rite , which was prevalent throughout spain in vis ##igo ##thic times , is now celebrated only in limited locations , principally the cathedral of toledo .
the cart ##hus ##ian rite is in use in a version revised in 1981 .
apart from the new elements in this revision , it is substantially the rite of gr ##eno ##ble in the 12th century , with some ad ##mi ##xt ##ure from other sources .
among other differences from the roman order of mass , the deacon prepares the gifts while the ep ##istle is being sung , the celebrating priest wash ##es his hands twice at the offer ##tory and says the eu ##cha ##rist ##ic prayer with arms extended in the form of a cross except when using his hands for some specific action , and there is no blessing at the end of mass .
this is now the only extant mass rite of a catholic religious order ; but by virtue of the ec ##cles ##ia dei ind ##ult some individuals or small groups are authorized to use some now defunct rites .
the order of saint benedict has never had a rite of the mass peculiar to it , but it keeps its very ancient benedictine rite of the liturgy of the hours .
in africa pro ##con ##sul ##are , located in present - day tunisia ( of which carthage was the capital ) , the african rite was used before the 7th - century arab conquest .
it was very close to the roman rite ; so much so that western liturgical traditions have been classified as belonging to two streams , the north african - rome tradition , and the gall ##ica ##n ( in the broad sense ) tradition encompassing the rest of the western roman empire , including northern italy .
the ancient celtic rite was a composite of non - roman ritual structures ( possibly antioch ##ian ) and texts not exempt from roman influence , that was similar to the mo ##zar ##abi ##c rite in many respects and would have been used at least in parts of ireland , scotland , the northern part of england and perhaps even wales , cornwall and somerset , before being authoritative ##ly replaced by the roman rite in the early middle ages .
" celtic " is possibly a mis ##no ##mer and it may owe its origins to augustine ' s re - evan ##gel ##isation of the british isles in the 6th century .
little is known of it , though several texts and lit ##urg ##ies survive .
some christians – typically groups not in communion with the roman catholic church , especially some western orthodox christian communities in communion with eastern orthodox churches , e . g . celtic orthodoxy – have attempted to breathe life into a reconstruction of the celtic rite the historical accuracy of which is debated .
historical evidence of this rite is found in the remnants of the st ##owe ( lo ##rr ##ha ) miss ##al .
the gall ##ica ##n rite is a retrospective term applied to the sum of the local variants , on similar lines to that designated elsewhere as the celtic rite ( above ) and the mo ##zar ##abi ##c rite , which faded from use in france by the end of the first millennium .
it should not be confused with the so - called neo - gall ##ica ##n liturgical books published in various french dioceses after the council of trent , which had little or nothing to do with it .
several local rites ( more properly uses or variants of the roman rite ( most with gall ##ica ##n elements some with byzantine liturgical and tradition elements ) of limited scope existed , but are now defunct .
the sar ##um rite ( more properly sar ##um use ) , a defunct variant on the roman rite originating in the diocese of salisbury , which had come to be widely practised in england and scotland around the 153 ##0s , while the protestant reformation swept across continental europe ; practised alongside limited other variants such as the use of york , lincoln use , bangor use , and hereford use .
it has a legacy in its influence on later anglican liturgy .
the cologne use , used in the diocese of cologne ( ) prior to 1570 .
the metz use , created by ar ##nu ##lf of metz and ama ##lar ##ius of metz in the ninth century – used in alsace - lorraine , the netherlands , and flemish and wall ##onia ##n lands until the beginning of the twentieth century .
the lyon ##ese rite of the diocese of lyon , france , which some consider to have been ( rather than milan ) the centre of diffusion of the gall ##ica ##n liturgy ; it is maintained in a few parishes in lyon .
the ni ##dar ##os use , long defunct , based mainly on imported english liturgical books , used in pre - reformation norway .
the uppsala use , suppressed during the reformation , formerly the dominant variant of the roman rite used in northern sweden .
the a ##quil ##eia ##n rite , a defunct rite originating in the former patriarch ##ate of a ##quil ##eia in northern italy .
the ben ##eve ##nto rite , a defunct latin rite originated in this city in italy .
the es ##z ##ter ##go ##m use ( defunct : archdiocese of es ##z ##ter ##go ##m , used between the 12th and 17th centuries primarily in the archdiocese of es ##z ##ter ##go ##m , and in its su ##ff ##ragan dioceses .
similar rites were also in slovakia and in southern , central , and western poland .
these usage ##s of roman liturgy was the closest to roman ( today vatican ) rites with some small byzantine - slavic elements .
some religious orders celebrated mass according to rites of their own , dating from more than 200 years before the papal bull quo pri ##mum .
these rites were based on local usage ##s and combined elements of the roman and gall ##ica ##n rites .
following the second vatican council , they have mostly been abandoned , except for the cart ##hus ##ian rite ( see above ) .
religious orders of more recent origin have never had special rites .

the canadian association for free expression ( cafe ) is a canadian political group led by paul from ##m , a white su ##pre ##mac ##ist .
established in 1981 , cafe is committed to the promotion and defense of total freedom of speech , and publishes the free speech monitor ten times a year .
although it began in ontario , it has also been incorporated in alberta .
opponents have accused cafe of racism , arguing that it does not merely support the free speech rights of far right groups , but also promotes their views .
cafe has criticized what it considers injustice ##s against white people in canada , and has argued that canadian laws do not robust ##ly defend the free speech of whites , and are too weighted in favour of minorities .
cafe has campaigned ( along with the defunct white nationalist groups canadian heritage alliance and northern alliance ) for the release of brad love , whom it claimed was jailed for expressing his nat ##ivist sentiments .
cafe has also campaigned for the release of holocaust den ##iers ernst zu ##nde ##l and david irving , and against human rights lawyer richard warm ##an and the canadian human rights commission .
on november 23 , 2007 , ontario superior court justice monique met ##iv ##ier ruled that from ##m and cafe had libel ##led warm ##an , and ordered them to pay $ 30 , 000 in damages and to post full re ##tra ##ctions within ten days on all the websites on which the def ##ama ##tory comments were posted .
the ontario court of appeal upheld the judgment in december 2008 with damages being raised to $ 40 , 000 , as from ##m was ordered to pay an additional $ 10 , 000 towards warm ##an ' s legal costs .

the british motor museum in warwickshire , england , holds the world ' s largest collection of historic british cars .
there are over 300 classic cars on display from the british motor industry heritage trust and the jaguar heritage trust .
the collection , now cared for by the british motor industry heritage trust , was developed in the 1970s when a new division of the british ley ##land motor corporation ( b ##lm ##c ) was formed to preserve and manage the company ' s collection of historic vehicles .
in 1979 , the company became b ##l heritage limited , adopting a new headquarters at stud ##ley , warwickshire .
two years later , a museum was opened at the london transport museum ' s former home of sy ##on park , west of london , where some 100 vehicles from the collection were put on display .
during the early 1980s , closer ties were made with other british motor manufacturers .
in 1983 , the collection was granted charitable status , and became the british motor industry heritage trust , and although there were now several manufacturers involved , the collection still carried a large bias towards the former british ley ##land companies .
austin - rover continued as the primary back ##er of the trust , and gradually the other companies withdrew their support .
meanwhile , the collection continued to grow .
in the late 1980s , it became evident that larger premises would be required as the collection developed .
several new sites were considered for a purpose built museum .
the present location was chosen , on the site of the former raf gay ##don airfield in south warwickshire , which was home to the rover group ' s design , technology and testing ground .
plans were drawn up and construction began in 1991 for the new heritage motor centre .
set in of grounds , the centre brought together all of the trust ' s operations for the first time , providing exhibition and storage space for the collection of over 250 vehicles and archive of over 2 million photographs , business records , bro ##chu ##res and drawings .
the site also includes conference facilities .
when rover group was taken over by bmw in 1994 , the british motor museum came under their ownership .
six years later , bmw sold the rover group , which meant that the centre changed hands yet again , this time under the ownership of the ford motor company .
this latest change of ownership means that the trust now had the opportunity to expand its collection to include all of the companies that have formed part of britain ' s motor manufacturing history .
following jaguar ' s decision to close their jaguar dai ##mler heritage centre , a small selection of the jaguar dai ##mler heritage collection has been on display at the museum .
in november 2015 the heritage motor centre closed for a £1 .
1 million refurbishment , and reopened on 13 february 2016 under the new name of british motor museum .
this is not an exhaust ##ive list — a complete list is provided on the centre ' s website .
due to space limitations , not all cars are exhibited at all times .
the metro 1 .
the british motor museum offers a research and registry service for several british car mar ##ques .
the archive houses authentic historical records by many of the major car manufacturers , including a range of original factory ledger ##s which record the details of individual vehicles as they came off the production line .
for a small fee , owners may send in their vehicle identification number ( vin - aka chassis number ) and / or engine numbers , and they will research the original production records for that vehicle and send back whatever information on the vehicle is available .
this is a ' certified copy of a factory record ' or more commonly known as a heritage certificate .
this can include such details as a list of the options the car was ordered with , the original paint colour and any identification numbers that may be missing .
this can be useful when applying for tax exemption or to obtain an age - related registration mark .

anne herbert , countess of pembroke , baroness herbert of cardiff ( 15 june 151 ##5 – 20 february 155 ##2 ) was lady - in - waiting to each of henry viii of england ' s six wives .
she was the younger sister of his sixth wife , catherine par ##r .
anne was born on 15 june 151 ##5 to sir thomas par ##r and maud green .
she was the youngest surviving child of five , having an older sister catherine and brother william par ##r , 1st marquess of northampton .
in 151 ##7 , when she was two years old , her father died of the sweating sickness leaving her mother a widow at twenty - five , pregnant , and with the grave responsibility of guarding the inheritance of the par ##r children .
maud green was a lady - in - waiting and con ##fi ##dant to catherine of aragon .
she was also head of the royal school at court where anne was educated alongside her sister catherine and other daughters of the nobility .
they were taught by the brilliant humanist scholar joan ll ##uis vi ##ves who was the principal tutor at the royal school .
anne would have been taught french , latin , philosophy , theology , and the classics .
maud green had already taught her children to read and write when they were small .
anne herself later said that her education at home was based on the approach used in the family of sir thomas more where boys and girls were educated together ; as was the case with the par ##rs until her brother left home in 152 ##5 to join the household of henry fitzroy , 1st duke of richmond and somerset .
sometime in 152 ##8 , maud green secured her 13 - year - old daughter , anne , a post at court as maid - of - honour to queen catherine of aragon .
anne was then made a ward of king henry .
when anne bo ##ley ##n was crowned queen in 153 ##3 , anne par ##r continued in the same capacity as maid - of - honour .
she quickly succumbed to the spell of queen anne ' s charismatic personality and following the queen ' s example , she became an ardent supporter of the new faith .
after anne bo ##ley ##n ' s fall from power and subsequent execution , anne remained at court in the service of the new queen , jane seymour .
anne par ##r served all of henry viii ' s queens from the mid - 153 ##0s , and is one of the few women to have been lady - in - waiting to all six .
she was one of the few present at the baptism of prince edward on 15 october 153 ##7 and was part of the funeral co ##rte ##ge of jane seymour .
when king henry took as his fourth wife anne of cl ##eves , anne returned to her role as maid - of - honour , which she remained in when queen anne was su ##pp ##lan ##ted by catherine howard .
following queen catherine ' s arrest for adultery , anne par ##r was entrusted with the queen ' s jewels .
in february 153 ##8 , anne married sir william herbert , esq ##ui ##re of the king ' s body .
herbert was the son of sir richard herbert , the illegitimate son of william herbert , 1st earl of pembroke .
it is likely that anne met her husband at court .
it is not known whether or not the marriage was a love match , but both anne and her sister catherine had been attracted to dash ##ing men of action who were slightly di ##sr ##ep ##utable .
the herbert ##s , due to king henry ' s newly found in ##fat ##uation for catherine , appeared to be in the king ' s favour , as for the next few years anne and her husband received a succession of royal grants which included the abbey of wilton in wiltshire ( pulled down and built over for wilton house in the 1540 ##s ) , re ##mes ##bury ( north wiltshire ) , and cardiff castle .
they also used bay ##nard ' s castle as their london residence .
anne had three children by her husband : henry , who succeeded his father ; edward herbert ; and anne herbert .
for the birth of her second son , anne ' s sister loaned her the manor of han ##worth in middlesex for her lying in .
after the birth , anne visited lady her ##tford , who had also just given birth , at sy ##on house near richmond .
in august , the queen sent a barge to bring anne by river from sy ##on back to westminster .
anne par ##r was a witness to the wedding ceremony performed at hampton court palace on 12 july 154 ##3 , when king henry married her sister catherine .
in september 154 ##4 , william herbert was knighted on the battlefield at the siege of bo ##ulo ##gne during the king ' s campaign against the french .
anne was her sister ' s chief lady - in - waiting and the sisters were close .
anne was also part of the cl ##ique of protestants who surrounded the new queen .
in 154 ##6 , fellow protestant anne ask ##ew was arrested for heresy .
those who opposed the queen tried to gain a confession from ask ##ew that the queen , her sister , and the other women were protestants .
queen catherine and some of her closest friends had previously shown favour to the arrested woman .
stephen gardiner , bishop of winchester ; thomas wr ##iot ##hes ##ley ; and richard rich were involved in tor ##turing anne ask ##ew and inter ##ro ##gating her about her connections to the ladies at court who were suspected to be protestants , in particular : anne par ##r ; the queen ; katherine willoughby ; anne stan ##hope ; and anne cal ##thorpe , countess of sussex .
gardiner and wr ##iot ##hes ##ley obtained the king ’ s permission to arrest and question the queen about her religious beliefs .
catherine visited the king in his bed ##cha ##mber and ad ##roi ##tly managed to persuade the king that her interest in the new religion had been undertaken solely as a means to provide stimulating conversation to distract the king from the pain caused by his ul ##cer ##ous leg .
henry was app ##eased , and before the arrests were due to take place , he was reconciled to catherine .
on 28 january 154 ##7 , the king died .
after henry viii ' s death , when the queen dowager ' s household was at chelsea , both anne and her son edward were part of the household there .
her husband , william herbert was appointed as one of the guardians to the new king , edward vi .
catherine shortly afterward married thomas seymour , lord sud ##eley , lord high admiral of england , who was an uncle of king edward .
in september 154 ##8 , following the birth of a daughter , mary seymour , catherine par ##r died of pu ##er ##per ##al fever .
on 10 october 155 ##1 , anne ' s husband was raised to the peerage as baron herbert of cardiff and on 11 october 155 ##1 was created earl of pembroke .
in 155 ##3 he received the disgrace ##d duke of somerset ' s wiltshire estates , including rams ##bury and a newly built mansion at bed ##win bro ##il , as well as extensive woodland on the borders of the new forest .
the herbert ##s had been friends of somerset until he fell from favour .
herbert was also granted , on the attain ##der of sir thomas arun ##dell , ward ##our castle and park , and he obtained some property which had belonged to the diocese of winchester .
the ward ##our property subsequently reverted to the arun ##dell family by exchange and purchase , but pembroke ' s increase of wealth exceeded that of any of his colleagues .
anne died on 20 february 155 ##2 .
at the time of her death , she was one of the ladies of the lady mary , the future queen mary i . william married as his second wife , anne talbot , but the marriage produced no children .

the wasps ( ) is the fourth in chronological order of the eleven surviving plays by ari ##sto ##pha ##nes , the master of an ancient genre of drama called ' old comedy ' .
it was produced at the lena ##ia festival in 422 bc , a time when athens was enjoying a brief res ##pit ##e from the pe ##lo ##pon ##nesian war following a one - year truce with sparta .
as in his other early plays , ari ##sto ##pha ##nes sat ##iri ##zes the dem ##ago ##gue cl ##eon , but in the wasps he also rid ##ic ##ules one of the athenian institutions that provided cl ##eon with his power base : the law courts .
the play has been thought to ex ##em ##plify the conventions of old comedy better than any other play , and it has been considered to be one of the world ' s greatest comedies .
the play begins with a strange scene — a large net has been spread over a house , the entry is barr ##ica ##ded and two slaves , x ##ant ##hia ##s and so ##sia ##s , are sleeping in the street outside .
a third man is positioned at the top of an exterior wall with a view into the inner courtyard but he too is asleep .
the two slaves wake and we learn from their ban ##ter that they are keeping guard over a " monster " .
the man asleep above them is their master and the monster is his father — he has an unusual disease .
x ##ant ##hia ##s and so ##sia ##s challenge the audience to guess the nature of the disease .
addiction ##s to gambling , drink and good times are suggested but they are all wrong — the father is addicted to the law court : he is a phil ##elia ##ste ##s ( ) or a " trial ##op ##hil ##e " .
the man ' s name is phil ##oc ##le ##on ( which suggests that he might be addicted to cl ##eon ) , and his son ' s name is the very opposite of this — b ##del ##y ##cle ##on .
the symptoms of the old man ' s addiction include irregular sleep , obsession ##al thinking , paranoia , poor hygiene and ho ##arding .
counsel ##ling , medical treatment and travel have all failed to solve the problem , and now his son has turned the house into a prison to keep the old man away from the law courts .
b ##del ##y ##cle ##on wakes and he shouts to the two slaves to be on their guard — his father is moving about .
he tells them to watch the drains , for the old man can move like a mouse , but phil ##oc ##le ##on surprises them all by emerging instead from the chimney disguised as smoke .
b ##del ##y ##cle ##on is luckily on hand to push him back inside .
other attempts at escape are also barely defeated .
the household settles down for some more sleep and then the chorus arrives — old ju ##ror ##s who move warily through the muddy roads and are escorted by boys with lamps through the dark .
learning of their old comrade ' s imprisonment , they leap to his defense and swarm around b ##del ##y ##cle ##on and his slaves like wasps .
at the end of this fray , phil ##oc ##le ##on is still barely in his son ' s custody and both sides are willing to settle the issue peacefully through debate .
the debate between the phil ##oc ##le ##on and b ##del ##y ##cle ##on focuses on the advantages that the old man personally derives from voluntary jury service .
phil ##oc ##le ##on says he enjoys the flat ##tering attention ##s of rich and powerful men who appeal to him for a favourable verdict , he enjoys the freedom to interpret the law as he please ##s since his decisions are not subject to review , and his ju ##ror ' s pay gives him independence and authority within his own household .
b ##del ##y ##cle ##on responds to these points with the argument that ju ##ror ##s are in fact subject to the demands of petty officials and they get paid less than they deserve — revenues from the empire go mostly into the private tre ##as ##uri ##es of men like cl ##eon .
these arguments have a para ##ly ##sing effect on phil ##oc ##le ##on .
the chorus is won over .
phil ##oc ##le ##on refuses to give up his old ways , so b ##del ##y ##cle ##on offers to turn the house into a courtroom and to pay him a ju ##ror ' s fee to judge domestic disputes .
phil ##oc ##le ##on agrees , and a case is soon brought before him — a dispute between the household dogs .
one dog ( who looks like cl ##eon ) accuse ##s the other dog ( who looks like lac ##hes ) of stealing a sicilian cheese and not sharing it .
witnesses for the defense include a bowl , a pest ##le , a cheese - gr ##ater , a bra ##zier and a pot .
as these are unable to speak , b ##del ##y ##cle ##on says a few words for them on behalf of the accused .
a group of pup ##pies ( the children of the accused ) is ushered in to soft ##en the heart of the old ju ##ror with their plain ##tive cries .
phil ##oc ##le ##on is not softened , but his son easily fools him into putting his vote into the ur ##n for ac ##qui ##ttal .
the old ju ##ror is deeply shocked by the outcome of the trial — he is used to convictions — but his son promises him a good time and they exit the stage to prepare for some entertainment .
while the actors are offs ##tage , the chorus addresses the audience in a conventional para ##bas ##is .
it praises the author for standing up to monsters like cl ##eon and it cha ##stis ##es the audience for its failure to appreciate the merits of the author ' s previous play ( the clouds ) .
it praises the older generation , ev ##oke ##s memories of the victory at marathon , and bitterly de ##pl ##ores the go ##bbling up of imperial revenues by un ##worthy men .
father and son then return to the stage , now arguing with each other over the old man ' s choice of attire .
he is addicted to his old jury ##man ' s cloak and his old shoes and he is suspicious of the fancy wool ##len garment and the fashionable spartan foot ##wear that b ##del ##y ##cle ##on wants him to wear that evening to a sophisticated dinner party .
the fancy clothes are forced upon him , and he is instructed in the kind of manners and conversation that the other guests will expect of him .
at the party , phil ##oc ##le ##on declares his reluctance to drink any wine — it causes trouble , he says — but b ##del ##y ##cle ##on assure ##s him that sophisticated men of the world can easily talk their way out of trouble , and so they depart optimistic ##ally for the evening ' s entertainment .
there is then a second para ##bas ##is ( see note at end of this section ) , in which the chorus touches briefly on a conflict between cl ##eon and the author , after which a household slave arrives with news for the audience about the old man ' s app ##all ##ing behaviour at the dinner party : phil ##oc ##le ##on has got himself abusive ##ly drunk , he has insulted all his son ' s fashionable friends , and now he is assault ##ing anyone he meets on the way home .
the slave depart ##s as phil ##oc ##le ##on arrives , now with ag ##gr ##ie ##ved victims on his heels and a pretty flute girl on his arm .
b ##del ##y ##cle ##on appears moments later and angrily re ##mons ##tra ##tes with his father for kidnapping the flute girl from the party .
phil ##oc ##le ##on pretend ##s that she is in fact a torch .
his son isn ' t fooled and he tries to take the girl back to the party by force but his father knocks him down .
other people with gr ##ie ##vances against phil ##oc ##le ##on continue to arrive , demanding compensation and threatening legal action .
he makes an ironic attempt to talk his way out of trouble like a sophisticated man of the world , but it in ##fl ##ame ##s the situation further .
finally , his alarmed son drag ##s him indoors .
the chorus sings briefly about how difficult it is for men to change their habits and it com ##men ##ds the son for fi ##lia ##l devotion , after which the entire cast returns to the stage for some spirited dancing by phil ##oc ##le ##on in a contest with the sons of car ##cin ##us .
note : some editors ( such as barrett ) exchange the second para ##bas ##is ( lines 126 ##5 – 91 ) with the song ( lines 145 ##0 – 73 ) in which b ##del ##y ##cle ##on is commended for fi ##lia ##l devotion .
about two years before the performance of the wasps , athens had obtained a significant victory against its rival , sparta , in the battle of sp ##ha ##cter ##ia .
right ##ly or wrongly , most athenian ##s credited cl ##eon with this victory , and he was then at the height of his power .
constitutional ##ly , supreme power lay with the people as voters in the assembly and as ju ##ror ##s in the courts , but they could be manipulated by dem ##ago ##gues skilled in or ##atory and supported by networks of satellites and inform ##ers .
cl ##eon had succeeded per ##icles as the dominant speaker in the assembly , and increasingly he could manipulate the courts for political and personal ends , especially in the prosecution of public officials for mis ##mana ##gement of their duties .
ju ##ror ##s had to be citizens over the age of thirty and a corps of 6000 was enrolled at the beginning of each year , forming a conspicuous presence about town in their short brown cloak ##s , with wooden st ##aves in their hands .
the work was voluntary but time - consuming and they were paid a small fee : three ob ##ols per day at the time of the wasps .
for many ju ##ror ##s , this was their major source of income and it was virtually an old - age pension .
there were no judges to provide ju ##ries with legal guidance , and there was no legal appeal against a jury ' s verdict .
ju ##ror ##s came under the sway of lit ##ig ##ious politicians like cl ##eon who provided them with cases to try and who were influential in per ##su ##ading the assembly to keep up their pay .
however it is not necessarily true that cl ##eon was exploit ##ing the system for ve ##nal or corrupt reasons , as argued in the wasps .
ari ##sto ##pha ##nes ' plays promote conservative values and support an honourable peace with sparta , whereas cl ##eon was a radical democrat and a leader of the pro - war faction .
misunderstanding ##s were inevitable .
cl ##eon had previously attempted to prose ##cute ari ##sto ##pha ##nes for sl ##ander ##ing the pol ##is with his second play the babylonian ##s , and though the legal result of these efforts is unknown , they appear to have sharpened the poet ' s satirical edge , as evidenced later in the un ##rel ##enting attack on cl ##eon in the knights .
the second para ##bas ##is in the wasps implies that cl ##eon re ##tal ##iated for his dr ##ub ##bing in the knights with yet further efforts to int ##imi ##date or prose ##cute ari ##sto ##pha ##nes , and the poet may have publicly yielded to this pressure for a short time .
whatever agreement was reached with cl ##eon , ari ##sto ##pha ##nes glee ##fully rene ##ged on it in the wasps , presenting cl ##eon as a treacherous dog manipulating a corrupted legal process for personal gain .
43 ##1 : the pe ##lo ##pon ##nesian war commenced .
42 ##6 : ari ##sto ##pha ##nes won first prize at the city dion ##ys ##ia with his second play , the babylonian ##s ( now lost ) , and he was subsequently prosecuted by cl ##eon for being the author of sl ##ander ##s against the pol ##is .
425 : athens obtained a significant victory against sparta in the battle of sp ##ha ##cter ##ia and cl ##eon successfully claimed responsibility for it .
42 ##4 : ari ##sto ##pha ##nes won first prize at the lena ##ia with the knights in which he lamp ##oon ##ed cl ##eon mer ##ci ##lessly .
42 ##3 : athens and sparta agreed to a one - year truce .
ari ##sto ##pha ##nes ' play the clouds came third ( i . e . last ) .
422 : the wasps was performed at the lena ##ia , winning second place .
according to a character in pl ##uta ##rch ' s dinner - table discussion , ( written some 500 years after the wasps was produced ) , old comedy needs commentators to explain its abs ##tr ##use references , in the same way that a banquet needs wine waiter ##s .
here is the wine list for the wasps as supplied by modern scholars .
mega ##ra : a neighbour and historically a rival to athens , it is mentioned in line 57 as the reputed origin of comic drama .
law courts : athens had ten law courts in 422 bc , of which these three are mentioned here by name : the new court in line 120 , the court at l ##yk ##os in line 38 ##9 and the ode ##ion in line 110 ##9 .
as ##cle ##pie ##ia : temples dedicated to the god of healing , the one mentioned in line 123 was located near athens on the island of ae ##gina .
del ##phi : one of the most sacred sites in greece , it is said by phil ##oc ##le ##on in line 159 to be the source of a fearful prophecy concerning himself .
sci ##one : a city on the promo ##nto ##ry of cha ##lc ##idi ##ce , it revolt ##ed against athenian rule two days after the athenian truce with sparta and it was now under siege ; this was the only fighting athenian ##s were engaged in at that time .
b ##del ##y ##cle ##on says in line 210 that he would rather serve there than guard his father .
by ##zan ##tium : originally captured from persian forces by the greeks in 47 ##8 bc , and subsequently taken from the control of pau ##san ##ias by the athenian ##s in 47 ##6 , a garrison had been stationed there ever since its revolt from athenian rule in 440 - 43 ##9 .
the chorus of old ju ##ror ##s mention it in line 236 while re ##mini ##sc ##ing about their time as soldiers there .
